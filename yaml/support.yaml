title: Support

description: |
  Passion for supporting our customers on their PCF journey, and ability to approach support issues with a customer-focussed mindset. You are able to handle interrupt-driven and exploratory work (e.g. questions on slack, on-call escalations, participation in cross-team meetings.) You ask relevant questions about an issue, figuring out what a customer needs to move forward, and drive it to resolution. You can communicate what you know respectfully to different audiences. You can also share what you still don’t know, and help identify the steps to learn more. You can apply your acquired CF knowledge on the fly, and are able to explore creative solutions to help meet the customer midway.

  _One example of success in this area_: Your PM notes that there is an open support ticket that the team should help with. You don’t have much context on the issue, but go into the Slack channel with an open mind. You ask good foundational questions, learning where assumptions have been made, and where evidence has been found. After speaking with the customer and with Pivotal Support, you realize that this is a known issue in an upstream product, and point support in the right direction. You explain how you got to this conclusion, and stay in the Slack channel until it’s clear that the issue has been resolved and the customer is satisfied with the outcome.
