  title: Technical Execution
  description: >-
    You can be depended upon to pick up a story from the backlog, do it well (quickly / dependably /
    transparently / correctly / valuably) and drive it to delivery. You ramp up quickly on new
    teams, and are soon productive as a solo or pair.


    One example of success in this area: You are trusted to drive stories to completion, and answer
    on-call escalations. Your anchor can depend on you to pair/solo on any story in the backlog, and
    provide leadership on tracks that need extra guidance.


    Another example of success in this area: You join a team whose main responsibility is
    integrating assets from other teams, and deploying them to a long, running production
    environment. You have minimal experience with operating the platform at scale. You are able
    to learn the tribal knowledge on the team quickly, and are able to execute on stories in the
    backlog with little guidance. Soon after, other pairs rely on you to onboard new team members,
    approach you with questions relating to the domain, and to reliably drive to completion
    uncertain/risky/technically complex stories.
- id: engineering-process
  title: Engineering Process
  description: >-
    You understand the importance of maintaining feedback loops on an engineering team. You can
    expand on the philosophy behind our engineering process. You can innovate on our existing
    process to tailor practices to your team's needs.


    One example of success in this area: Your team is not very disciplined about build failures in
    CI. You start a conversation with your team to understand what could make CI more useful and
    share the pain you observe when CI is red. After discussing it, you make a chore to refactor
    your concourse pipeline, in order to get more actionable signals from each portion of the
    pipeline. Over time you use these signals to incrementally improve your CI pipeline and educate
    your teammates about the importance of integrating early and often. You are eventually able to
    get your team to a point where CI being red is no longer the norm.
- id: domain-expertise
  title: Domain Expertise
  description: >-

    You understand our Products (e.g. PAS, PKS): How they work together, how they work with the broader ecosystem.
    You can navigate this system and its engineering teams on a broad level,
    and know which areas to consider in problem-solving.


    One example of success in this area: You are trying to decide how to implement a database
    migration in CCDB. You know that this change may affect CC’s communication with Diego, with
    Routing, and with Networking. You surface how you think the changes will affect those teams to
    your PM/Anchor and work to find a solution that would minimize the impact on those teams.
    Additionally, you loop those teams into the conversation, and ensure that the solution you are
    moving forward with works as desired for them.
- id: collaboration
  title: Collaboration
  description: >-
    Ability to communicate clearly, proactively, and kindly. You initiate the communication in
    challenging situations. You behave in a way that ensures safety, inclusion, and recognition of
    fellow pivots. Your behavior leaves space for others to speak, and to disagree with your views.
    You contribute positively to our culture.


    One example of success in this area: One of your teammates has a frequent habit of interrupting
    others in meetings, especially when they’re excited about an idea. You find them after a
    meeting, and directly but kindly deliver this feedback. They don’t know what you’re talking
    about. You ask if it would be okay to stop them next time this happens. They agree. In the
    future, the team feels comfortable with giving feedback about interrupting in meetings in the
    moment.
- id: project-leadership
  title: Project Leadership
  description: >-

    You ensure the productivity and health of your engineering team. You can act as a
    coordinator/liaison for initiatives on the team. You can act according to your team’s
    priorities. You ensure that voices are heard, and can take initiative to act alone when needed.
    Overall, you are a role model on your team for all aspects of our culture and process.


    One example of success in this area: You are anchoring your team. You’ve been working with your
    PM and Designer to outline a new epic, and would like to share your learnings with the team. You
    facilitate a meeting where folks brainstorm and share their thoughts. After the meeting, you
    work with the PM to scope out explorations that the team can do to de-risk the epic. You
    incorporate the output of the explorations, your knowledge of the problem, and work with the PM
    to choose a path forward. You share the outcomes with your team, and continue to be open to
    input from them as the features are developed.
- id: alignment
  title: Alignment and Adaptability
  description: >-
    You take on the most important challenge with an open mind; to what degree are you willing and
    capable to take on the challenge that the organization would find the most impactful, even if
    it's not your first choice. You actively consider how you can best help the organization, and
    work with leadership to align your strengths and goals with important challenges. You improve
    leadership's visibility into difficult problems while engaging positively in solving them.


    Example of success in this area: You would like to work on <project 1> next, to improve your
    technical execution skill. Leadership would like you to rotate to <project 2>, which is
    under-allocated and needs your experience and guidance. You have already been on this team
    before, and would probably not choose to take on this challenge of your own volition. However,
    you agree to the change in plans, approach <project 2> with positivity, find ways to grow your
    skills in other areas while you are there, and are able to address the challenges on the team.

- id: support
  title: Support
  description: >-
    Passion for supporting our customers on their PCF journey, and ability to approach support
    issues with a customer-focussed mindset. You are able to handle interrupt-driven and exploratory
    work (e.g. questions on slack, on-call escalations, participation in cross-team meetings.) You
    ask relevant questions about an issue, figuring out what a customer needs to move forward, and
    drive it to resolution. You can communicate what you know respectfully to different audiences.
    You can also share what you still don’t know, and help identify the steps to learn more. You can
    apply your acquired knowledge on the fly, and are able to explore creative solutions to help
    meet the customer midway.


    One example of success in this area: Your PM notes that there is an open support ticket that the
    team should help with. You don’t have much context on the issue, but go into the Slack channel
    with an open mind. You ask good foundational questions, learning where assumptions have been
    made, and where evidence has been found. After speaking with the customer and with Pivotal
    Support, you realize that this is a known issue in an upstream product, and point support in the
    right direction. You explain how you got to this conclusion, and stay in the Slack channel until
    it’s clear that the issue has been resolved and the customer is satisfied with the outcome.
- id: technical-decision-making
  title: Technical Decision-Making
  description: >-
    Ability to weigh several factors when making technical decisions. Some factors that could be
    considered are:

      - maintainability
      - security implications
      - performance implications
      - effects on downstream consumers
      - extensibility
      - adaptability of system / cost of change
      - support

    One example of success in this area: You have been noticing a lot of bugs arising the output of
    <command 1> and <command 2>. Additionally, you often see stories in the backlog around adding
    the same sort of features to both commands. You look through the code and notice that even
    though both commands are following separate code paths they are trying to accomplish roughly
    similar things. You share your findings with the team, and embark on a path to explore how to
    have both commands to follow similar code paths. After coming up with a plan, you get buy-in
    from your PM and other engineers to do this refactor as part of a larger epic. While you do this
    refactor you consider the maintainability and longer term extensibility of the system while you
    consolidate these paths. Finally, over time you observe that the number of bugs around those 2
    commands decrease, and the team feels more comfortable navigating around that part of the
    codebase.

- id: flow
  title: Flow
  description: >-
    You understand how software makes it from an engineering team to the customer, from start to
    finish. You can evaluate and explain the "flow" of work through this system, and identify
    bottlenecks. You can help your team prioritize these bottlenecks, optimizing for a positive
    impact on downstream consumers or for customers. You use your flow knowledge to advise teams
    surrounding yours, and to avoid blocking their work.


    One example of success in this area: An investigation in your backlog has been blocked for days.
    Your teammates have made a valiant effort, but no one has found a way forward. You find a way to
    implement the feature without needing the blocking dependency. You outline a plan for
    integrating the dependency once it’s ready, and talk to the upstream team to finalize it.
