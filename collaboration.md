## Collaboration

Ability to communicate clearly, proactively, and kindly. You initiate the communication in challenging situations. You behave in a way that ensures safety, inclusion, and recognition of fellow pivots. Your behavior leaves space for others to speak, and to disagree with your views. You contribute positively to our culture.

One example of success in this area: One of your teammates has a frequent habit of interrupting others in meetings, especially when they’re excited about an idea. You find them after a meeting, and directly but kindly deliver this feedback. They don’t know what you’re talking about. You ask if it would be okay to stop them next time this happens. They agree. In the future, the team feels comfortable with giving feedback about interrupting in meetings in the moment.
