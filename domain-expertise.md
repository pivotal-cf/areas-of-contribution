## CF Domain Expertise


You understand the CF Products: How they work together, how they work with the larger ecosystem of non-CF Products. You can navigate the CF system and its engineering teams on a broad level, and know which areas to consider in problem-solving.

One example of success in this area: You are trying to decide how to implement a database migration in CCDB. You know that this change may affect CC’s communication with Diego, with Routing, and with Networking. You surface how you think the changes will affect those teams to your PM/Anchor and work to find a solution that would minimize the impact on those teams. Additionally, you loop those teams into the conversation, and ensure that the solution you are moving forward with works as desired for them.

<!-- P1 -->
<td valign="top"><ul>
  <li>Shows curiosity about the product their team is building (eg: how it helps customers, who are the downstream consumers, how to downstream consumers rely on it)</li>

  <li>Shows curiosity about bigger picture (boxes and lines) of CF (eg: watched videos from Cloud Foundry Summit, reads materials relating to technical concepts when presented by colleagues)</li>
</ul></td>

<!-- P2 -->
<td valign="top"><ul>
  <li>Has working knowledge about the product their team is building.</li>

  <li>Is learning about how other teams/downstream consumers/customers use their product</li>

  <li>Relates stories in the backlog to downstream consumers it would affect</li>

  <li>Diagnoses issues that involve interactions with multiple CF components</li>

  <li>Can explain boxes-and-lines version of their team's product</li>
</ul></td>

<!-- P3 -->
<td valign="top"><ul>
  <li>Has sound knowledge of the team's product(s) and its downstream consumers, and can be counted upon to represent the team's interests.</li>

  <li>Preemtively identifies dependencies/repercussions of features on downstream consumers and past releases</li>

  <li>Provides context on their team for historical decisions, features in past releases, and their team's domain</li>

  <li>Can explain boxes-and-lines version of CF and is able to provide a more detailed view on CF components</li>

  <li>Can ramp up a new PM on team domain, or fill in for their PM for short periods of time.</li>
</ul></td>

<!-- P4 -->
<td valign="top"><ul>
  <li>Has working knowledge of an area of CF (eg: the BOSH ecosystem, the Platform, Logging and Metrics)</li>

  <li>Preemptively identifies dependencies/repercussions of an epic to all consumers within a domain area; can suggest changes to required components to resolve it</li>

  <li>Teaches Pivots on their team about a particular CF domain area</li>

  <li>Leverages their knowledge of related domain concepts to better the product</li>

  <li>Can explain how a CF domain area has evolved over time (including familiarity with features in past releases)</li>
</ul></td>

<!-- P5 -->
<td valign="top"><ul>
  <li>Takes measures to dissipate their CF domain knowledge with a goal of empowering their team</li>
