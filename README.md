# Areas Of Contribution

This *public* repo contains the set of skills, organized by "area" and "P-level", that CF Engineering management in SF and LA use when gathering feedback and evaluating engineers.

Have questions about how to interpret all of this?  Ask your manager, or open an issue on this repo!

## Motivation
We intent for the skills listed in this repo to describe the *impact* that a Pivot has.  We're trying to not focus too much on specific activities.

This is because we want to avoid perverse incentives or "gamifiying" the performance of activities to the detriment of outcomes.  Also, there is often more than one activity, or way of doing an activity, that can lead to a particular outcome.  So we want to align our standards with positive outcomes for our teams, our customers, and our company.

For more background on the thinking behind our current feedback process, [watch this video](https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/cloud-foundry/resources/events-recordings/tech-talks/tt_feedback).

## How to interpret "impact" and "frequency"

- **IMPACT: High**: When Pivot does this line item, they do it well. Roughly this maps to meeting expectations and above.

- **IMPACT: Low**: When Pivot does this line item, they could do it better.  Roughly this maps to not meeting expectations and below.  When marking this, please provide additional context (there's space on the form, or share directly with the Pivot's manager).

- **FREQUENCY**: This helps with the “when” from above. This is about *consistency* and *taking initiative*.

All boxes are optional.  Use them any any combination:

- Example 1: If the Pivot is having a “neutral” or "unknown" impact for a skill, then leave "impact" blank and use frequency axis only.

- Example 2: If a line item isn't applicable for any reason, then leave the entire line item blank.

- Example 3: If a Pivot often meets expectations, but still has some room to grow, then check *both* "IMPACT: high" *and* "IMPACT: low".
